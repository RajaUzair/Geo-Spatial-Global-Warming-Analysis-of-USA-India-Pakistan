Execution of Code:
 - Relative paths are set for the datasets and the
   shape files
 - Just download the zip folder (containing everything)
 - Unzip it, and load the Code file and 'Run All'
 
 - The Dataset and Shape file is of large size, so it may 
   take time to run, plot etc.
 - For example, USA Temperatures plotting may take  20-25 minutes

Extra Libraries:

  - import plotly.express as px:- 
 		 This library is used for creating interactive visualizations in Python, 
                 and is easy to quickly create graphs and charts for data exploration.
